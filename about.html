      <p>
        Welcome to Boston Eats! We created this data visualization to help
        fellow Bostonians learn more about the various restaurants of the
        Greater Boston Area. Boston has a large university student population,
        and we felt that a visualization like ours would be very helpful to
        people in our demographic. We used a Boston restaurants dataset from
        Kaggle which contained several CSV files with figures related to
        restaurants located in Boston. We found some of these figures to be
        especially informative as they consisted of topics like cuisine types,
        ingredients, prices, and even locational data such as longitude and
        latitude. Given the amount of data that we had to work with, we then
        brainstormed what things we could use with the data. Some of our ideas
        consisted of showing ingredient usage (ex. meat vs vegetable ratio) for
        restaurants or creating a nutritional guide that could be filtered based
        on a user’s preferences. Since we also have geographical data to work
        with, we even considered ideas like plotting our restaurants on a map
        representation of Boston which could be filtered based on user
        preferences or even creating a virtual trail through a map of Boston
        that users can follow if they wanted to explore several different
        combinations of cuisines. In the end, we settled on the idea of an
        interactive map that plotted every restaurant on it. When interacting
        with each restaurant, users would see info like ingredient usage,
        nutrition, and dishes specific to that restaurant.

    <div class="description">
      The CSV files in the Kaggle dataset are structured like a SQL table. To
      dynamically retrieve data for a specific restaurant or dish, we first
      deployed a MySQL database on AWS RDS with the CSV data and then created an
      API that serves the data to our visualizations.

    <div class="section">Our Design Process:</div>
    <div class="description">
      <p>
        We first started our design process with our visualization map. Since we
        had locational data for each of the restaurants in the dataset, we felt
        that users would get the best experience if we were able to plot out
        each of the restaurants on a map for them to see where all of the
        establishments existed in real life. Once that was done, we started to
        brainstorm on what information we wanted to show and how we wanted to
        explain it to the user. After some thought, we decided to narrow our
        topics down to each restaurant's menu, price scale, average nutritional
        information, and ingredient usage. For each restaurant’s ingredients, we
        decided to best represent this using a donut chart that displayed the
        top 25 most used ingredients at each specific establishment. We
        concluded on using the top 25 ingredients as many restaurants in our
        dataset had minimal usage of certain ingredients which would make
        representing them in the donut chart derivative. For average nutritional
        value, we showed this off using a bar chart that took every dish in a
        specific restaurant’s menu and returned its average carbs, fiber,
        protein, etc. based on the info for each dish. We also implemented a
        list for each restaurant’s menu of items that the reader could
        reference. Additionally, we added a hover effect for the user in which
        they could determine an establishment’s price scale, cuisine type, and
        name simply by glossing over each dot on the map. Of course, we had our
        fair share of bumps along the design process as well. For starters, we
        had issues regarding a lack of legends for the map and the initial font
        we used was hard to see for many users. Other testers complained that
        the donut chart lacked a way to see concrete values or they felt that
        the color encoding could be changed up. We were also recommended to do
        away with our initial zooming feature as it felt unnecessary given the
        goal of our visualization. From this feedback, we made some adjustments
        to our visualization like adding a hover for the number of times certain
        ingredients appeared in the donut chart, doing away with the zooming
        function, adding in a legend to show users the price scale more
        effectively, changing out visualization’s font colors, and even adding a
        filter bar at the bottom of the screen that could filter out specific
        restaurants from the screen based on the user’s cuisine selection.
