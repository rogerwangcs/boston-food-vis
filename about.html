      <p>
        Welcome to Boston Eats! We created this data visualization to help
        fellow Bostonians learn more about the various restaurants of the
        Greater Boston Area. Boston has a large university student population,
        and we felt that a visualization like ours would be very helpful to
        people in our demographic. We used a boston restaurants dataset from
        Kaggle which contained several CSV files with figures related to
        restaurants located in Boston. We found some of these figures to be
        especially informative as they consisted of topics like cuisine types,
        ingredients, prices, and even locational data such as longitude and
        latitude. Given the amount of data that we had to work with, we then
        brainstormed what things we could use with the data. Some of our ideas
        consisted of showing ingredient usage (ex. meat vs vegetable ratio) for
        restaurants or creating a nutritional guide that could be filtered based
        on a userâ€™s preferences. Since we also have geographical data to work
        with, we even considered ideas like plotting our restaurants on a map
        representation of Boston which could be filtered based on user
        preferences or even creating a virtual trail through a map of Boston
        that users can follow if they wanted to explore several different
        combinations of cuisines. In the end, we settled on the idea of an
        interactive map that plotted every restaurant on it. When interacting
        with each restaurant, users would see info like ingredient usage,
        nutrition, and dishes specific to that restaurant.

    <div class="section">Processing Our Data:</div>
    <div class="description">
      The csv files in the Kaggle dataset are structured like a SQL table. To
      dynamically retrieve data for a specific restaurant or dish, we first
      deployed an MySQL database on AWS RDS with the csv data, and then created
      an API that serves the data to our visualizations. <br />
